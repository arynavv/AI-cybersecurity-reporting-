# AI-cybersecurity-reporting-
This project proposes a decentralized, AI-powered cybercrime reporting system designed for rural and semi-urban India. It enables citizens to easily file complaints through a simple, multilingual, voice-enabled interface supported by Google Gemini. Users can upload evidence, auto-generate FIR-ready reports, and track case status in real time.
